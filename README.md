## Computer Engineering Graduation Thesis || Data Analyses by Using Optimization Algorithms

Optimization is the problem of finding a set of inputs to an objective function that results in a maximum or minimum function evaluation. 
Firefly algorithm is one of the metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. 
In this study, we emphasize Firefly algorithm and compare our two data (Iris and Breast Cancer) with standard K-Means and analyze them according to the optimized version.


The document contains the data analyses of Iris and Breast Cancer datasets according to the K-Means clustering extended by optimization algorithms named as especially Firefly and with some other algorithms. 
The mission of the project is to create and compare the analyses by using optimization algorithms for Graduation Thesis given by Dr. Havva Esin Ãœnal.
